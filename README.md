### DB entities and relations
For the sake of simplicity and quicker MVP development, currently only the very basic entities should be implemented. Therefore features like multi-point routes, delivery time constraints and so on are omitted for now, but can be added later.

Routes will be calculated on the fly for the sake of interactivity and simplicity and will not be cached in the DB.
